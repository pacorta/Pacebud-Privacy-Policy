How We Protect Your Personal Data
At Pacebud, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users’ data. We have implemented the following measures to ensure that any personal data collected is handled with the utmost care:
1. Data Encryption:
All data transmitted between the app and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS (SSL/TLS) protocols to prevent unauthorized access during transmission.
2. Firebase Security:
We use Google Firebase to store and manage data, which complies with industry-standard security practices. Firebase automatically encrypts data at rest and during transit.
3. Authentication and Access Control:
Only authorized individuals have access to user data, and we implement role-based access controls to limit exposure to sensitive information.
4. Regular Security Audits and Monitoring:
We monitor our systems regularly to detect and prevent unauthorized access. Any security incidents are immediately investigated and addressed.
5. User Control over Data:
Users have control over their data and can request its deletion or modification by contacting us at any time.
6. Compliance with Standards:
We follow the relevant data protection regulations, including GDPR (for European users) and CCPA (for California users), to ensure transparency and safeguard user privacy.
While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is secure and that users are protected, there always remains the risk of harm. The Internet as a whole can be insecure at times and therefore we are unable to guarantee the security of user data beyond what is reasonably practical.
Children
We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under 13 years of age, the personal data
